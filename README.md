# My NumPy Journey

I am eager to share my knowledge with the world! This repository contains my implementations of basic operations using NumPy, a popular Python library for numerical computing. As part of my journey in the mathematics for machine learning course, I explored various functionalities of NumPy and documented my learning process here.

## Introduction

NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these data structures efficiently.

## Installation

To install NumPy, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install numpy
```

Alternatively, if you are using Anaconda, you can install NumPy with:

```bash
conda install numpy
```

## Basic Operations

### Array Creation

Learn how to create arrays from lists, use functions like `arange`, `linspace`, and create multidimensional arrays.

### Array Manipulation

Explore reshaping arrays, indexing, slicing, and joining arrays.

### Mathematical Operations

Perform element-wise operations, use universal functions (ufuncs), and apply mathematical functions like `sin`, `cos`, and `exp`.

### Statistical Operations

Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other statistical measures on arrays.

## Examples

Here are some examples of basic operations using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Creating an array
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print("Array:", arr)

# Array manipulation
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape((5, 1))
print("Reshaped Array:\n", reshaped_arr)

# Mathematical operations
squared_arr = np.square(arr)
print("Squared Array:", squared_arr)

# Statistical operations
mean_val = np.mean(arr)
print("Mean Value:", mean_val)
```

## Contributing

Feel free to fork this repository, create issues, or submit pull requests. Any contributions to enhance the examples or add more functionalities are welcome.

By sharing this repository, I hope to help others understand the basics of NumPy and encourage them to explore its powerful features in their own projects. 

### Happy coding!
